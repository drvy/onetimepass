    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Will the information be deleted by just visiting the link?</strong>

            <strong>For how long will this link be available?</strong>

            <strong>Can I delete it before the time limit?</strong>
            <p>If you click the delete button now, it will be deleted instantly. If you leave this page, the only option to delete it will be to open the sensitive message by visiting the link.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How is the information stored?</strong>
            <p>The sensitive information is encrypted in your browser and stored as ilegible text in our server. In order to decypher it, the user must input the secret phrase. The decryption process is also done in the browser. We do not store the secret phrase.</p>
